## Deep Learning: Driver Distraction Detector
### Project Overview
The project aims to develop a driver distraction detector using deep learning techniques to identify different types of distracted drivers based on their facial and body movements, such as arm movements and facial poses. The project underwent multiple stages of testing to increase the accuracy of predictions, initially starting with simple neural networks and progressing to the utilization of pretrained models for improved performance.

### Objectives
- Identify Distraction Types: Classify different types of driver distractions based on facial and body movements.
- Increase Prediction Accuracy: Enhance the accuracy of distraction detection through iterative testing and model refinement.
- Utilize Deep Learning: Leverage deep learning techniques, including pretrained models, to improve the performance of the distraction detector.
### Tools and Technologies
- TensorFlow: For building and training deep learning models for distraction detection.
- Scikit-learn: For additional machine learning tasks and evaluation of model performance.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model performance metrics.
